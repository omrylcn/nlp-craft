## 1. Introduction: Artificial Intelligence Agents and Agentic AI

In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of an "agent" refers to software or systems that have the ability to perceive, make decisions, and take actions in their environment. These systems can range from programs that perform simple tasks to autonomous systems with complex problem-solving capabilities.

Agentic AI takes this a step further by emphasizing the concept of autonomy. These types of artificial intelligence systems can make decisions on their own, take actions, and learn and adapt to achieve specific goals. They can think like a virtual assistant, reason, and adapt to changing conditions.

Agentic AI operates in four basic stages:

1. **Perception**: Collecting data from the surrounding world
2. **Reasoning**: Understanding this data and comprehending what is happening
3. **Action**: Deciding what to do based on understanding
4. **Learning**: Improving over time by utilizing feedback and experiences

## 2. Basic AI Agent Patterns

AI agents use various patterns to accomplish different tasks. In this section, we will examine four fundamental agent patterns.

### 2.1. Reflection Pattern

The reflection pattern is an approach that allows agents to improve by analyzing their own performance. Agents perform self-evaluation to enhance their outputs and decision-making processes.

![Reflection Pattern](images/image.png)

**How the Reflection Pattern Works**:

1. The AI agent produces an output
2. It applies self-determined criteria to evaluate the output
3. It identifies problems or areas for improvement
4. It improves the output and produces a better version
5. If necessary, it repeats this cycle several times

This pattern allows the agent to continuously improve itself, especially in complex tasks requiring high quality (programming, writing, analysis, etc.).

### 2.2. Tool Use Pattern

The tool use pattern allows agents to expand their capabilities by using external resources. In this pattern, the agent decides which tool to use based on the given task and calls that tool to integrate the results.

![Tool Use Pattern](images/image-2.png)

**How the Tool Use Pattern Works**:

1. **Function Definition**: Detailed descriptions of available tools and required parameters are provided to the LLM
2. **Tool Selection**: The agent decides which tool to use based on the task at hand
3. **Function Call**: The agent creates a string using a special format (usually JSON) to call the selected tool
4. **Execution**: A post-processing step identifies these function calls, executes them, and returns the results to the LLM
5. **Integration**: The LLM integrates the tool's output into its final responses

This pattern allows LLMs to perform tasks they couldn't do on their own, such as making calculations, conducting internet research, or interacting with APIs.

### 2.3. Planning Pattern

The planning pattern aims to solve complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable subtasks. In this pattern, a controller LLM divides the task into parts and selects the most appropriate model for each part.

![Planning Pattern](images/image-1.png)

**How the Planning Pattern Works**:

1. **Task Decomposition**: An LLM, acting as a controller, breaks down a complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks
2. **Model Selection**: For each subtask, a specific model is selected to perform that task
3. **Task Execution**: The selected expert models complete the subtasks, and the result is given to the controller LLM
4. **Response Generation**: The controller LLM combines the results of all subtasks to create a final response

This pattern is ideal for solving complex problems using a "divide and conquer" strategy. Different specialized models can be used for each subtask.

### 2.4. Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern

The multi-agent collaboration pattern allows specialized agents with different roles to work together to solve complex problems. Each agent handles tasks in their area of expertise, allowing them to complete complex jobs that a single agent couldn't do.

![Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern](images/image-3.png)

**How the Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern Works**:

1. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent is designed to fulfill specific roles or tasks, such as software engineer, product manager, or designer
2. **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are divided into smaller, manageable subtasks that can be distributed among agents
3. **Communication and Coordination**: Agents interact with each other to share information and coordinate their actions to achieve common goals
4. **Distributed Problem Solving**: The system uses the collective capabilities of multiple agents to address problems too complex for a single agent to solve

This pattern is particularly effective when different perspectives and expertise are required, mimicking collaboration in human teams. For example, an agent in the role of CEO can assign tasks to other expert agents and coordinate results.

## 3. Types of Artificial Intelligence Agents

Artificial intelligence agents are divided into various types based on their complexity and capabilities. In this section, we will examine different agent types and their applications.

### 3.1. Simple Reflex Agents

Simple reflex agents are the most basic type of agent that operate according to condition-action rules. These agents act directly based on their current perceptions, without considering the past or future.

**Complexity**: Low

**Applications/Use Cases**:
- Suitable for simple tasks where the response depends only on the current perception
- Basic customer service bots
- Simple automation tasks

**Example**: A thermostat perceives room temperature and turns the heater on if it's below a certain threshold, or off if it's above. Past temperature data or future predictions are not considered.

### 3.2. Model-Based Reflex Agents

Model-based reflex agents use a model to track the internal state of the environment. This model allows the agent to perform better in partially observable environments.

**Complexity**: Medium

**Applications/Use Cases**:
- Useful in partially observable environments
- More advanced customer service bots that can answer follow-up questions
- Autonomous vehicles that need to track moving objects

**Example**: A self-driving car can use a model that observes the speed and direction of other vehicles to predict their future positions. This allows the car to adapt to traffic flow and navigate safely.

### 3.3. Goal-Based Agents

Goal-based agents evaluate the future consequences of their actions to reach a specific goal. These agents have a "what if" mentality and select the best actions to achieve their goals.

**Complexity**: High

**Applications/Use Cases**:
- Suitable for complex decision-making tasks
- Robotic systems
- Planning systems
- Advanced game AI

**Example**: An AI playing chess evaluates many possible moves in each turn and selects the best strategy to achieve the goal of winning.

### 3.4. Utility-Based Agents

Utility-based agents optimize their performance according to utility functions. These agents evaluate not only whether they reached the goal but also how well they reached it.

**Complexity**: Very High

**Applications/Use Cases**:
- Recommendation systems
- Financial trading systems
- Complex optimization problems

**Example**: A movie recommendation system optimizes its utility function to recommend movies that the user will most enjoy, based on the user's past viewing habits, ratings, and preferences of similar users.

### 3.5. Learning Agents

Learning agents improve their performance by learning from their experiences. These agents receive feedback from their environment to better understand their surroundings and perform more effective actions over time.

**Complexity**: Very High

**Applications/Use Cases**:
- Adaptive game AI
- Personalized health systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles

**Example**: Language models can learn to produce more accurate and useful responses over time by fine-tuning with user feedback.

### 3.6. Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems are systems where multiple agents interact to achieve common goals. In these systems, agents can collaborate, compete, or negotiate to solve problems.

**Complexity**: Variable (Medium - Very High)

**Applications/Use Cases**:
- Transportation systems
- Robotics
- Social networks
- E-commerce

**Example**: In a traffic management system, multiple agents can control traffic lights and share information to optimize traffic flow.

## 4. Core Components of Agents

The core building blocks of AI agents are the components that allow them to perceive their environment, process information, and perform intelligent actions. In this section, we will examine the fundamental components of an AI agent in detail.

![Agent Structure](images/image-15.png)

### 4.1. Perception

Perception is the component that allows the agent to collect data from the external world. This is the first step for the agent to acquire information about its environment.

**Examples of Perception**:
- Understanding textual inputs
- Processing image data
- Reading sensor data
- Speech recognition
- Retrieving data from APIs

Perception capability determines how "aware" the agent is. More advanced perception mechanisms allow the agent to process more diverse and complex data.

### 4.2. Reasoning

Reasoning is the component that processes and interprets the perceived data. This allows the agent to understand the current situation and make logical decisions.

**Reasoning Features**:
- Data analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Logical inference
- Probabilistic thinking
- Decision-making under uncertainty

In modern LLM-based agents, reasoning is usually enhanced with techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT) or tree search.

### 4.3. Action

Action refers to the activities carried out by the agent based on the result of its reasoning process. This is how the agent influences its environment.

**Types of Actions**:
- Generating text responses
- Making function calls
- Sending API requests
- Performing database operations
- Controlling physical systems (in robotic agents)

The effectiveness of actions determines how well the agent fulfills its task.

### 4.4. Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is the component where the information possessed by or accessible to the agent is stored. This can include both pre-programmed knowledge and learned information.

**Types of Knowledge Bases**:
- Knowledge stored in the LLM's parameters
- Vector databases
- Graph databases
- Relational databases
- File systems

The breadth and accessibility of the knowledge base affect how knowledgeable and capable the agent can be.

### 4.5. Learning

Learning is the component that allows the agent to learn from its experiences and improve its performance over time. This enables the agent to be an adaptive and evolving system.

**Learning Methods**:
- Reinforcement learning
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Contextual learning

Learning capability allows the agent to become smarter and more effective over time.

### 4.6. Communication Interface

The communication interface is the component that allows the agent to interact with other systems or humans. This is how the agent exchanges information with the external world.

**Types of Communication Interfaces**:
- Text-based chat interfaces
- Visual interfaces
- Voice-based interfaces
- API integrations
- SDKs

A well-designed communication interface ensures effective use of the agent's capabilities.

## 5. Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer sits at the center of any cognitive architecture. This layer is responsible for managing the agent's memory, current state, reasoning processes, and overall planning.

![Orchestration Layer](images/image-10.png)

### 5.1. Memory Management

Memory management allows the agent to store previous interactions and learned information. This ensures that the agent is consistent and context-aware.

**Types of Memory**:
- **Short-Term Memory**: Stores temporary information for the current task or conversation
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores permanent information that needs to be preserved for a long time
- **Topic-Based Memory**: Stores information organized by specific topics or domain knowledge

Effective memory management ensures that the agent remains consistent and knowledgeable over time, allowing it to learn from previous interactions.

### 5.2. State Tracking

State tracking allows the agent to monitor its current state. This helps the agent know where it is, what it's doing, and what it should do next.

**State Tracking Features**:
- Tracking current tasks and subtasks
- Managing user preferences and settings
- Monitoring conversation flow
- Tracking process states

Proper state tracking ensures that the agent remains consistent and focused.

### 5.3. Reasoning and Planning Frameworks

Reasoning and planning frameworks are structures used by the agent to guide reasoning and planning. These frameworks help the agent interact more effectively with its environment and complete tasks.

**Reasoning and Planning Techniques**:
- Chain of Thought
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
- Tree search algorithms
- Backtracking
- Goal-oriented reasoning

Well-designed reasoning and planning frameworks significantly enhance the agent's ability to solve complex problems.

## 6. Tool Integration for Agents

There are three main types of tools that agents can use to expand their capabilities: extensions, functions, and data stores. These tools allow agents to interact with the external world and perform more complex tasks.

### 6.1. Extensions

Extensions can be thought of as pre-built connectors that allow an agent to easily interact with different APIs.

![Extensions](images/image-11.png)

**Features of Extensions**:
- Provides standardized access to APIs
- Runs on the agent side
- Typically used for access to external services
- Used through documented methods

**Example**: An extension connecting to a Google Flights API could allow the agent to query flight information and provide travel recommendations to users.

### 6.2. Functions

Functions are autonomous code modules that perform specific tasks and can be reused when needed. They work similarly to how software developers use functions.

![Functions](images/image-13.png)

**Features of Functions**:
- Isolated pieces of code that perform specific tasks
- Can be called and reused when needed
- Executed on the client side (unlike extensions)
- Typically used for computation, data transformation, or logical operations

**Example**: A function could analyze a user's financial data to calculate spending trends or perform language processing tasks on a text document.

### 6.3. Data Stores

Data stores are external, updatable sources of information that an agent can access. These stores extend the agent's memory and allow it to access more information.

![Data Stores](images/image-13.png)

**Features of Data Stores**:
- External, updatable sources of information
- Accessible through query mechanisms
- Can store different types of information (text, structured data, files)
- Complements and extends agent memory

**Example**: A data store could store company policies, product information, or frequently asked questions. The agent can retrieve relevant information from this store when a user asks a question.

## 7. Agent Learning Approaches

Various learning approaches are used to enable AI agents to make better decisions. In this section, we will examine three main approaches that allow agents to learn and develop.

### 7.1. In-Context Learning

In-context learning is when the model learns instantly during inference time using prompts, tools, and few-shot examples.

**Features of In-Context Learning**:
- The model's weights are not updated
- Examples and instructions are provided within the prompt
- Occurs during inference time
- Provides rapid adaptation
- Requires no additional training

**Example**: An agent can learn how to approach a new task by studying solution examples of similar tasks provided in the prompt.

```python
# In-context learning example
prompt = """
Determine whether the following texts are positive or negative by examining the examples below:

Example 1:
Text: "This movie is great! I definitely recommend watching it."
Sentiment: Positive

Example 2:
Text: "Complete waste of time. It was a terrible experience."
Sentiment: Negative

Now analyze this text:
Text: "The price is a bit high but the quality is worth it."
Sentiment:
"""

response = llm(prompt)  # The model is expected to learn from examples and perform analysis
```

### 7.2. Retrieval-Based In-Context Learning

Retrieval-based in-context learning enhances in-context learning by dynamically retrieving relevant information, examples, or tools from an external memory or database.

**Features of Retrieval-Based In-Context Learning**:
- Relies on an external knowledge source
- The most relevant information for the current task is dynamically retrieved
- The context in the prompt is enriched with retrieved information
- Forms the basis of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems

**Example**: A customer service agent can generate a response by retrieving the most relevant policy or procedure information from a vector database related to the user's question.

```python
# Retrieval-based in-context learning example - RAG
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Preparing documents
documents = [...] # Collection of documents
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Creating vector database
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)

# Creating retrieval-based question-answering chain
retriever = db.as_retriever()
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever
)

# Answering the query
query = "Can you explain the product return policy?"
response = qa.run(query)
```

### 7.3. Fine-Tuning Based Learning

Fine-tuning based learning involves training a model on a specific dataset containing labeled examples of tool usage, decision-making processes, or reasoning steps. This updates the model's weights and embeds the knowledge into the model itself.

**Features of Fine-Tuning Based Learning**:
- The model's weights are updated
- Requires training on a custom dataset
- Reduces dependency on prompts
- Provides more consistent performance
- Uses less memory at deployment time

**Example**: An agent can be fine-tuned on thousands of labeled examples of tool selection and usage to better learn which tool to select in which situations.

```python
# Fine-tuning based learning example
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Preparing dataset for fine-tuning
training_data = [
    {"messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "How will the weather be today?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "I need to use the weather tool for this question."},
        {"role": "function", "name": "get_weather", "content": '{"location": "Istanbul", "unit": "celsius"}'},
        {"role": "function", "name": "get_weather_result", "content": '{"temperature": 25, "conditions": "Sunny"}'},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today in Istanbul, the weather will be 25°C and sunny."}
    ]},
    # More examples...
]

# Starting the fine-tuning process
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file=training_data,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
)

# Using the fine-tuned model
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=response.fine_tuned_model,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Will it rain tomorrow?"}
    ]
)
```

## 8. Agentic AI vs AI Agents

Understanding the differences between Agentic AI and AI agents is important for evaluating the capabilities and limitations of these technologies. In this section, we will compare the fundamental differences between these two concepts.

| Feature | Agentic AI | AI Agents |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Level of Autonomy | Highly autonomous, can act independently | Limited autonomy, requires human input |
| Goal Orientation | Goal-oriented, solves problems on its own | Task-oriented, follows specific instructions |
| Learning Capabilities | Continuously learns and develops | May not learn or only learns within specific rules |
| Complexity | Manages complex, dynamic environments | Manages simpler, structured tasks |
| Decision-Making Process | Makes decisions based on reasoning and analysis | Provides responses to pre-programmed inputs |
| Interaction with Environment | Actively adapts to its environment and changes | Responds to specific inputs but does not adapt |
| Response to Change | Autonomously changes its goals and methods | Limited ability to adapt to new situations |

Agentic AI represents systems with higher levels of autonomy and decision-making ability, which can adapt to dynamic environments and learn and develop over time. In contrast, AI agents are typically designed to perform specific, instruction-focused tasks with limited autonomy.

**Agentic AI Example**: A smart home system can learn the habits of home residents over time, monitor weather conditions, and track energy prices to automatically adjust heating, lighting, and security systems to optimize comfort and energy efficiency.

**AI Agents Example**: A customer service chatbot can recognize customer questions using predefined patterns and provide specific responses, but may not be able to respond to questions outside its programmed domain or adapt to unexpected situations.

## 9. Application Examples with LangChain and LangGraph

In this section, we will show how AI agents can be implemented with practical examples using LangChain and LangGraph. These libraries provide powerful tools for developing agent-based systems.

### 9.1. Creating a Simple ReAct Agent

The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern is a powerful approach that combines an agent's reasoning and action execution steps. Let's create a simple ReAct agent using LangGraph.

```python
import os
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# Setting the API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"

# Defining the search tool
@tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Returns information by searching the internet."""
    # A real implementation would use a search API
    # We're doing a simple simulation in this example
    if "weather" in query.lower():
        return "Today in Istanbul, the weather is 22°C and partly cloudy."
    elif "exchange rate" in query.lower():
        return "Current exchange rates: 1 USD = 32.5 TL, 1 EUR = 35.2 TL"
    else:
        return f"No search results found for '{query}'."

# Defining the calculator tool
@tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Calculates mathematical expressions."""
    try:
        return str(eval(expression))
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Calculation error: {str(e)}"

# Initializing the LLM model
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125")

# List of tools the agent can use
tools = [search, calculator]

# Creating the ReAct agent
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools)

# Running the agent
def run_agent(query):
    input_message = {"messages": [("human", query)]}
    response = agent.invoke(input_message)
    return response["messages"][-1][1]  # Return the last response

# Example query
query = "Find out the weather in Istanbul and calculate the Fahrenheit equivalent of the temperature."
result = run_agent(query)
print(result)
```

In this example, we created a simple ReAct agent that can use two basic tools (search and calculator). The agent understands the query, selects appropriate tools, calls the tools, and integrates the results to provide a response.

### 9.2. Function-Calling Agents

Function-calling capability is a powerful feature that allows agents to interact with external APIs. Let's create a function-calling agent with LangChain.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_core.tools import tool

# Defining tools
@tool
def get_weather(location: str, unit: str = "celsius") -> str:
    """Gets current weather for the specified location."""
    # A real implementation would use a weather API
    weather_data = {
        "istanbul": {"celsius": 22, "fahrenheit": 71.6, "conditions": "Partly Cloudy"},
        "ankara": {"celsius": 18, "fahrenheit": 64.4, "conditions": "Sunny"},
        "izmir": {"celsius": 25, "fahrenheit": 77, "conditions": "Clear"}
    }
    
    location = location.lower()
    if location not in weather_data:
        return f"Weather data not found for {location}."
    
    data = weather_data[location]
    temp = data["celsius"] if unit == "celsius" else data["fahrenheit"]
    unit_symbol = "°C" if unit == "celsius" else "°F"
    
    return f"In {location.capitalize()}, the weather is {temp}{unit_symbol} and {data['conditions']}."

@tool
def get_flight_info(origin: str, destination: str, date: str) -> str:
    """Gets flight information between two cities."""
    # A real implementation would use a flight API
    return f"Found 3 flights from {origin} to {destination} on {date}: at 08:00, 12:30, and 18:45."

# Creating prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful travel assistant. Help the user with their travel planning."),
    ("human", "{input}")
])

# Initializing the LLM model
model = ChatOpenAI()

# List of tools
tools = [get_weather, get_flight_info]

# Creating the function-calling agent
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(model, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

# Running the agent
response = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "I'm traveling from Istanbul to Izmir tomorrow. How will the weather be in Izmir and what are my flight options?"})
print(response["output"])
```

In this example, we created a travel assistant agent with tools for getting weather and flight information. The agent analyzes the user's question, calls the appropriate tools to gather the necessary information, and creates a comprehensive response.

### 9.3. Creating a Multi-Agent System

Multi-agent systems are an advanced approach where multiple specialized agents work together to solve complex tasks. Let's create a simple multi-agent system using LangGraph.

```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, List, Literal

# Defining state type
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List
    next: str

# Creating agents in different roles
ceo_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)
engineer_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)
designer_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)

def create_agent_node(agent_name, llm, system_message):
    def agent_node(state):
        # Getting all messages and generating response
        messages = state["messages"]
        system_msg = {"role": "system", "content": system_message}
        ai_msg = llm.invoke([system_msg] + messages)
        
        # Adding response to messages
        return {"messages": messages + [AIMessage(content=f"{agent_name}: {ai_msg.content}")]}
    
    return agent_node

# CEO agent
ceo_node = create_agent_node(
    "CEO",
    ceo_llm,
    "You are the CEO of a company. You make strategic decisions and assign tasks to other team members."
)

# Engineer agent
engineer_node = create_agent_node(
    "Engineer",
    engineer_llm,
    "You are a software engineer. You evaluate technical details and implementation strategies."
)

# Designer agent
designer_node = create_agent_node(
    "Designer",
    designer_llm,
    "You are a UX/UI designer. You specialize in user experience and interface design."
)

# Selecting the next agent
def decide_next_agent(state):
    last_message = state["messages"][-1].content.lower()
    
    if "technical" in last_message or "code" in last_message or "implementation" in last_message:
        return "engineer"
    elif "design" in last_message or "interface" in last_message or "ux" in last_message:
        return "designer"
    elif "decision" in last_message or "strategy" in last_message or "management" in last_message:
        return "ceo"
    else:
        return "end"

# Creating multi-agent graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Adding nodes
workflow.add_node("ceo", ceo_node)
workflow.add_node("engineer", engineer_node)
workflow.add_node("designer", designer_node)

# State selector
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "ceo",
    decide_next_agent,
    {
        "engineer": "engineer",
        "designer": "designer",
        "ceo": "ceo",
        "end": END
    }
)

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "engineer",
    decide_next_agent,
    {
        "engineer": "engineer",
        "designer": "designer",
        "ceo": "ceo",
        "end": END
    }
)

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "designer",
    decide_next_agent,
    {
        "engineer": "engineer",
        "designer": "designer",
        "ceo": "ceo",
        "end": END
    }
)

# Setting entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("ceo")

# Creating executable graph
agent_graph = workflow.compile()

# Running the multi-agent system
messages = [HumanMessage(content="We need to develop a new feature for our mobile app. We want a module where users can edit their photos with AI. How can we plan this project?")]

result = agent_graph.invoke({"messages": messages, "next": "ceo"})
for message in result["messages"]:
    print(message.content)
```

In this example, we created a simple multi-agent system consisting of a CEO, an engineer, and a designer. Each agent contributes to the project according to their area of expertise, and the system decides which agent will work in the next step based on the nature of the task.

## 10. Advanced Topics for Agents

In this section, we will examine advanced topics and challenges that may be encountered in the development of AI agents.

### 10.1. Memory Optimization in Agents

Agents may encounter memory limitations when executing long and complex tasks. Memory optimization aims to minimize memory usage while maintaining the agent's performance.

**Memory Optimization Techniques**:

1. **Memory Summarization**: Reducing the memory footprint by summarizing long interactions
```python
def summarize_memory(messages, max_tokens=1000):
    """Summarizes long message history."""
    if token_count(messages) <= max_tokens:
        return messages
    
    # Dividing messages into groups
    chunks = chunk_messages(messages)
    
    # Summarizing each group
    summaries = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        summary = summarize_chunk(chunk)
        summaries.append(summary)
    
    # Creating new memory
    new_memory = [{"role": "system", "content": "Previous conversation summary: " + " ".join(summaries)}]
    
    # Preserving the last few messages
    new_memory.extend(messages[-5:])
    
    return new_memory
```

2. **Selective Memory**: Keeping only information relevant to the current task in memory
3. **Hierarchical Memory**: Storing information at different levels according to importance and recency
4. **Vector-Based Memory**: Storing information in semantically similar groups and accessing when needed

### 10.2. Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

In multi-agent systems, effective communication between agents is critical. Communication protocols standardize information sharing and collaboration between agents.

**Types of Inter-Agent Communication**:

1. **Message-Based Communication**: Sending structured messages in formats like JSONL
```python
def send_message(sender_agent, receiver_agent, message_content, message_type="info"):
    """Sends structured messages between agents."""
    message = {
        "sender": sender_agent.id,
        "receiver": receiver_agent.id,
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "type": message_type,
        "content": message_content
    }
    
    receiver_agent.receive_message(message)
    return message
```

2. **Event-Based Communication**: Agents subscribing to certain events and receiving notifications when events occur
3. **Blackboard Systems**: Agents writing to and reading from a common information space
4. **Request-Response Model**: Agents requesting information or services from each other

### 10.3. Distributed Agent Systems

Distributed agent systems allow agents operating on different machines or locations to work together. These systems provide scalability and flexibility but also bring additional challenges.

**Distributed Agent System Architectures**:

1. **Federated Learning**: Systems where agents learn locally and only share model updates
2. **Cloud-Edge Architecture**: Hybrid systems where some agents operate in the cloud and others on edge devices
3. **P2P Agent Networks**: Systems where agents communicate directly with each other without a central coordinator
4. **Hierarchical Agent Systems**: Agent groups organized at different levels of responsibility

**Challenges in Distributed Systems**:
- Synchronization
- Fault tolerance
- Security and privacy
- Network latency and bandwidth constraints
