# AutoGen, LangGraph and CrewAI: Complete Comparison Guide 2025

## Introduction

The multi-agent AI landscape has matured significantly in 2024-2025, with these three frameworks emerging as the leading solutions for building production-ready AI agent systems. This comprehensive guide compares AutoGen, LangGraph, and CrewAI to help you make the right choice for your project.

**2024 was the year agents moved from prototypes to production.** Unlike the wide-ranging, fully autonomous agents people imagined with early tools, today's successful agents are more vertical, narrowly scoped, and highly controllable with custom cognitive architectures.

## 2. Quick Start Guide with Code Examples

### AutoGen v0.4 - Getting Started

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]"
```

**Basic Two-Agent Conversation:**

```python
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

# Create model client
model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
    model="gpt-4o",
    api_key="your-openai-key"
)

# Create assistant agent
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    model_client=model_client,
    description="A helpful AI assistant"
)

# Start conversation
response = await assistant.on_messages([
    {"role": "user", "content": "Help me plan a data analysis project"}
])
print(response.chat_message.content)
```

**Multi-Agent Team Example:**

```python
# Create specialized agents
data_analyst = AssistantAgent(
    name="data_analyst", 
    model_client=model_client,
    description="Expert in data analysis and statistics"
)

researcher = AssistantAgent(
    name="researcher",
    model_client=model_client, 
    description="Expert in research and information gathering"
)

# Agents can collaborate through message passing
```

### LangGraph - Getting Started

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain
```

**Simple Graph Workflow:**

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict

# Define state structure
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    task: str
    result: str
    step: str

# Define nodes (functions)
def research_node(state):
    # Simulate research
    result = f"Research completed for: {state['task']}"
    return {"result": result, "step": "analysis"}

def analysis_node(state):
    # Simulate analysis
    result = f"Analysis: {state['result']} - Key insights found"
    return {"result": result, "step": "complete"}

# Build the graph
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
builder.add_node("research", research_node)
builder.add_node("analysis", analysis_node)

# Define flow
builder.add_edge("research", "analysis")
builder.add_edge("analysis", END)
builder.set_entry_point("research")

# Compile and run
graph = builder.compile()
result = graph.invoke({"task": "Market research for AI tools", "result": "", "step": "start"})
print(result)
```

**Agent Integration:**

```python
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import Tool

# Create LLM-powered node
def llm_research_node(state):
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

    return {"result": result.content, "step": "analysis"}
```

### CrewAI - Getting Started

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install crewai
```

**Basic Crew Example:**

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

# Create agents with roles
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find comprehensive information about given topics",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with access to web resources",

**AutoGen Common Issues:**

```python
# Issue: Agent conversation loops
# Solution: Add termination conditions
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    model_client=model_client,
    description="A helpful assistant",
    # Add termination condition
    system_message="Respond with 'TERMINATE' when task is complete"
)

# Issue: Memory management
# Solution: Clear conversation history
def reset_agent_memory(agent):
    agent.reset()  # Clear conversation history
```

**LangGraph Common Issues:**

```python
# Issue: State not persisting
# Solution: Ensure proper checkpointer setup
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()  # For development
# or PostgresSaver for production
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Issue: Infinite loops in graph
# Solution: Add max iteration limits
def safe_node(state):
    if state.get("iterations", 0) > 10:
        return {"status": "max_iterations_reached"}
    # Your node logic here
    return {"iterations": state.get("iterations", 0) + 1}
```

**CrewAI Common Issues:**

```python
# Issue: Agents not collaborating properly
# Solution: Define clear task dependencies
research_task = Task(
    description="Research AI frameworks",
    agent=researcher,
    expected_output="Research findings"
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write blog post using research",
    agent=writer,
    expected_output="Blog post",
    context=[research_task]  # Clear dependency
)

# Issue: High execution costs
# Solution: Optimize task descriptions and use caching
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    cache=True,  # Enable caching
    memory=True,  # Reuse previous learnings
)
