"I'm an AI/ML engineer, and I spent my weekend diving deep into ReAct agents and LangGraph. What I discovered completely changed my understanding of how modern AI agents actually work."
Here's what I found: LangGraph's current create_react_agent function isn't actually a ReAct agentâ€”at least not the way every blog tutorial describes it. And here's the kicker: it doesn't need to be. We've witnessed a fundamental evolution from conductor to instrument.
The Great Disconnect: Blog Tutorials vs. Reality
What Every Blog Tutorial Tells You:
python# The "classic" ReAct pattern everyone writes about
while not done:
    thought = llm.generate("Think about this step...")
    action = llm.generate("What action should I take...")
    observation = execute_tool(action)
    # Rinse and repeat with manual orchestration
What LangGraph Actually Does:
python# The reality I discovered
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent = create_react_agent(
    model=reasoning_model,  # This does ALL the thinking
    tools=tools,           # Just tools, not orchestration
    state_modifier=...,    # Memory management
    checkpointer=...       # Persistence
)

# Where's the manual thought-action-observation loop? 
# There isn't one!
The "Wait, What?" Moment
My weekend went something like this:
Saturday Morning: "Let me finally master ReAct agents!"
Saturday Evening: "These blog tutorials don't match what I'm seeing in LangGraph..."
Sunday: "OH! The MODEL does all the reasoning! The framework is just infrastructure!"
